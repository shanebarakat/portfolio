              PillThought started as a vision shared by three close friends during our first year of university: Jay, a Pharmacy student (middle); Alex, a Computational Mathematics student (right); and myself, a Management Engineering student. Our goal was to combine our unique skill sets to address the technological gaps in the healthcare industry. By building impactful and cost-effective software solutions, we aim to make a tangible difference in the field while fostering affordability and accessibility.

              One of our standout projects is the Campus Pharmasave Mobile App, developed for the Campus Pharmasave Pharmacy in Waterloo, Ontario. This app serves as a digital coupon book, offering students discounts on medications, vitamins, and other products. It also allows users to book appointments and receive notifications when prescriptions are ready for pickup. The app has been a game-changer, <span className = 'text-white'>increasing the pharmacy’s revenue by 20%</span> while earning a <span className = 'text-white'>5-star rating on the iOS App Store</span>, with glowing reviews from students and pharmacy staff alike.
